This repository contains the data and the Python code used in my honors thesis: "Is Higher Enough? The Impacts of Indonesiaâ€™s Gender Quota on Female Candidates Ranking on Ballots"

The thesis is currently embargoed for a short period to complete the cleaning and formatting of the dataset created as part of the study. A preliminary version of the dataset is available and can be found by emailing myself at matthew.joesoep@gmail.com.

The "Data" folder contains the raw data I recorded from the 2004, 2009, 2014, and 2019 election cycles.

The "Analysis" folder contains the Python code used to generate the figures shown in the thesis and to process the data into the target variables used for the PooledOLS model in  the study.
