This repository contains the data and the Python code used in my honors thesis: "Is Higher Enough? The Impacts of Indonesiaâ€™s Gender Quota on Female Candidates Ranking on Ballots"

The thesis is currently embargoed for a short period to complete the cleaning and formatting of the dataset created as part of the study. A preliminary version of the dataset is available and can be found by emailing myself at matthew.joesoep@gmail.com.
